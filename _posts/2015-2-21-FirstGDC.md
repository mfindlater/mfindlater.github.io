title: My First GDC!
---

For the first time ever, my schedule actually allows me to go to the [Game Developer's Conference!](http://www.gdconf.com/) I am excited and a little overwhelmed, but I got some great advice from friends over at the [Philly Game Forge](http://phillygameforge.com/) and all over the internet. I still have some preparation left to do. I would like to bring a game I worked on or two. I will make sure to have plenty of business cards. I am in the middle of incorporating but I will have an updated resume because you never know. Lastly, I must prepare myself for...[partying](http://thatvenuspatrolwildrumpusparty.com/).

See you there!
